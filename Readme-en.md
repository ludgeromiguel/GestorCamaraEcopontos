## Explanation of work:
This was the final project made for the Imperative Programming course.
It's main objective was to create a system that allowed the manipulation/control of recycling bins in a 1000*1000 plan.
Some of the features allowed are:
- Insertion of waste in ecopoints, and there are 3 types of ecopoints, glass, cardboard and oil;
- Possibility to delete ecopoints;
- Use of files as a "database" enabling the user to load/save the ecopoint records in the file;
- Search/list system for recycling bins by type or quantity of full bins;
- Possibility of calculating the average amount of waste of each type;
- System to calculate the most efficient route to collect the garbage, and what would be the size of the route that the garbage truck would have to travel;
